NumPy: The Absolute Basics for Beginners
****************************************

This is a working outline for a future section introducing NumPy to absolute beginners. If you have comments or suggestions, please don’t hesitate to reach out!



- How to install NumPy
  
  - various operating systems 

  - If you don't have Python yet, consider using Anaconda as the easiest way to get started

    - The good thing about getting this Python distribution is is the fact that you don’t need to worry too much about separately installing NumPy or any of the major packages that you’ll be using for your data analyses, such as pandas, Scikit-Learn, etc.
    
    - If you do have Python, you can install NumPy with `conda install numpy` or `pip install numpy`
    
    - For more details, see the `Installation` section

- How to import NumPy

::

  import numpy as np 

(We shorten "numpy" to "np" in order to save time and also so that code is standardized so that anyone working with your code can easily understand and run it.)

- What is an array?

  - An array is a central data structure of the NumPy library. It's a grid of values and it contains information about the raw data, how to locate an element, and how to interpret an element. It has a grid of elements that can be indexed in `various ways <https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html#indexing-slicing-and-iterating>`_. The elements are all of the same type, referred to as the array `dtype`. 

  All of the values in an array should be the same type. An array can be indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers, by booleans, by another array, or by integers. The **rank** of the array is the number of dimensions. The **shape** of the array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.

  - One way we can initialize NumPy arrays is from nested Python lists. 

  - We can access the elements in the array using square brackets.

    - When you're accessing elements, remember that indexing starts at 0. That means that, if you want to access the first element in your array, you'll be accessing element "0".

- How to create an array (ndarray object)
- How to create a basic array


  - To create a NumPy array, you can use the function `np.array()`

  - All you need to do to create a simple array is pass a list to it. If you choose to, you can also specify the type of data in your list. You can find more information about data types `here <https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html#arrays-dtypes>`_.

::

    import numpy as np

    # create a 1-D array
    a = np.array([1,2,3])

    # print the first element of the array
    print(a[0])
    # this will print 1

  - reading in a CSV

::

  import pandas as pd

  # If all columns are the same type:
  x = pd.read_csv('music.csv').values

  # Otherwise, you can simply select the columns you need:
  x = pd.read_csv('music.csv', columns=['float_colname_1', ...]).values

  - Examples of commonly used NumPy dtypes
 
- More information about arrays

  - What else might it be called?

    - You might occasionally hear an array referred to as an "ndarray," which is shorthand for "N-dimensional array." You might also hear **1-D**, or one-dimensional array, **2-D**, or two-dimensional array, and so on. The numpy `ndarray` class is used to represent both matrices and vectors. A vector is an array with a single column, while a matrix referrs to an array with multiple columns.

  - What are the attributes of an array?

  - How do you know the shape and size of an array?

    - **ndarray.ndim** will tell you the number of axes, or dimensions, of the array.

    - **ndarray.shape** will display a tuple of integers that indicate the number of elements stored along each dimension of the array. If, for example, you have a 2D-array with 2 rows and 3 columns, the shape of your array is (2,3).

    - **ndarray.size** will tell you the total number of elements of the array. This is, in other words, the product of the elements of the array's shape.

    - For example:

::

      import numpy as np
      array_example = np.array([[[0, 1, 2, 3]
                                 [4, 5, 6, 7]],

                                 [[0, 1, 2, 3]
                                  [4, 5, 6, 7]],

                                  [0 ,1 ,2, 3]
                                  [4, 5, 6, 7]]])
      array_example.ndim
      # will return 3
      
      array_example.shape
      # will return (3,2,4)
      
      array_example.size
      # will return 24

- Can you reshape an array?
  
  - You can! `numpy.reshape` will give a new shape to an array without changing the data. Optional parameters you can specify are:

::

  numpy.reshape(a, newshape,order)

- **a** is the array to be reshaped.
- **newshape** is the new shape you want. You can specify an integer or a tuple of integers. If you specify an integer, the result wil be an array of that length. The shape should be compatible with the original shape.
- **order** 'C' means to read/write the elements using C-like index order,  ‘F’ means to read / write the elements using Fortran-like index order, ‘A’ means to read / write the elements in Fortran-like index order if a is Fortran contiguous in memory, C-like order otherwise.

For example:

::

  a = np.arange(6)
  print('Original array:')
  print(a)
  print('\n')

  b = a.reshape(3,2)
  print('Modified array:')
  print(b)

  # Result
  Original array:
  [0 1 2 3 4 5]


  Modified array:
  [[0 1]
   [2 3]
   [4 5]]

- What’s the difference between a Python List and a NumPy array? 

  - Why use NumPy?

- Indexing and Slicing
  - We can index and slice NumPy arrays in the same ways we can slice Python lists:

.. image:: images/np_indexing.png

- Basic array operations(np.sum, np.dot)

  - Operations on a single array

  - Unary operators

  - Binary operators

  - Once you've created your arrays, you can start to work with them. Let's say, for example, that you've created two arrays, one called "data" and one called "ones": 

.. image:: images/np_array_dataones.png

You can easily add them together with the plus sign.

.. image:: images/np_data_plus_ones.png
    :width: 100%

Of course, you can do more than just addition!

.. image:: images/np_sub_mult_divide.png
    :width: 100%

There are often times when you might want to carry out an operation between an array and a single number (also known as an operation between a vector and a scalar). For example, your  "data" array might, for example, contain information about distance in miles but you want to convert the information to kilometers. You can perform this operation with `data * 1.6`

.. image:: images/np_multiply_broadcasting.png

NumPy understands that the multiplication should happen with each cell. That concept is called *broadcasting*.

- How to compute mean, median, minimum, maximum, std, var

NumPy also performs aggregation functions. In addition to `min`,  `max`, and `sum`, you can easily run `mean` to get the average, `prod` to get the result of multiplying the elements together, `std` to get the standard deviation, and more.

.. image:: images/np_aggregation.png
  
- (include row-wise and column-wise compute)

  - It's very common to want to aggregate along a row or column. By default, every NumPy aggregation function will return the aggregate of the entire array:

::

  A = np.random.random((3, 4))
  print(A)

  # Result
  [[0.55466235 0.3424135  0.15217492 0.21755154]
  [0.009259   0.24416699 0.89009665 0.44347466]
  [0.22205557 0.03315231 0.45255134 0.41577852]]

  A.sum()

  # Result:
  5.103359574405063

  A.min()

  # Result
  0.030703756560824358

You can easily specify which axis you want the aggregation function to be computed. For example, you can find the minimum value within each column by specifying `axis=0`.

::

  A.min(axis=0)

  # Result
  array([0.03070376, 0.51914664, 0.14838017, 0.15097071])

The four values listed above correspond to the number of columns in your array. With a four-column array, you can expect to get four values as your result.

- How to pass a list of lists to create a 2-D array

- Creating Matrices

  - You can pass Python lists of lists to create a matrix to represent them in NumPy.

::

  np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])

.. image:: images/np_create_matrix.png

- Indexing and slicing operations can be useful when you're manipulating matrices:

.. image:: images/np_matrix_indexing.png

- You can aggregate matrices the same way you aggregated vectors:

.. image:: images/np_matrix_aggregation.png

- You can aggregate all the values in a matrix and you can aggregate them across columns or rows using the `axis` parameter:

.. image:: images/np_matrix_aggregation_row.png

- Once you've created your matrices, you can add and multiply them using arithmetic operators if you have two matrices that are the same size.

  .. image:: images/np_matrix_arithmetic.png

- You can do these arithmetic operations on matrices of different sizes, but only if the different matrix has only one column or onw row. In this case, NumPy will use its broadcast rules for the operation.

.. image:: images/np_matrix_broadcasting.png

- How to extract specific items from an array
- How to create sequences, repetitions, and random numbers
- NumPy can do everything we've mentioned in any number of dimensions, that's why it's called an N-Dimensional array.

Be aware that when NumPy prints N-Dimensional arrays, the last axis is looped over the fastest while the first axis is the slowest. That means that 

::

  np.ones((4,3,2))

will be printed:

::

  array([[[1., 1.],
        [1., 1.],
        [1., 1.]],

       [[1., 1.],
        [1., 1.],
        [1., 1.]],

       [[1., 1.],
        [1., 1.],
        [1., 1.]],

       [[1., 1.],
        [1., 1.],
        [1., 1.]]])

 
- There are often instances where we want NumPy to initialize the values of an array. NumPy offers methods like ones(), zeros() and random.random() for these instances. All you need to do is pass in the number of elements you want it to generate.

  .. image:: images/np_ones_zeros_random.png

  - np.linspace
  
  - np.logspace

  - np.tile
  
  - np.zeros

  - np.ones

- Random Number Generation (update below to numpy.random.Generator)

  - np.random.randn
  
  - np.random.randint
  
  - np.random.random
  
  - np.random.choice
  
  - np.random.RandomState, np.random.seed

  - You can also use the `ones()`, `zeros()`, and `random()` methods to create a matrix if you give them a tuple describing the deminsions of the matrix.

.. image:: images/np_ones_zeros_matrix.png

- How to get the unique items and the counts
- How to get index locations that satisfy a given condition 
- It's common to need to rotate your matrices. NumPy arrays have the property `T` that allows you to transpose a matrix.

.. image:: images/np_transposing_reshaping.png
      :width: 100%

- You may need to switch the dimensions of a matrix. This can happen when, for example you have a model that expects a certain input shape that might be different from your dataset. This is where the `reshape` method can be useful. You pass in the new dimensions that you want for the matrix

Formulas:
Implementing mathematical formulas that work on matrices and vectors is one of the things that make NumPy so highly regarded in the scientific Python community. 

For example, this is the mean square error formula (a central formula used in supervised machine learning models that deal with regression):

.. image:: images/np_MSE_formula.png
    :width: 100%


Implementing this formula is simple and straightforward in NumPy:

.. image:: images/np_MSE_implementation.png
    :width: 100%

What makes this work so well is that `predictions` and `labels` can contain one or a thousand values. They only need to be the same size. 
You can visualize it this way:

.. image:: images/.png
    :width: 100%(IMG)

In this example, both the predictions and labels vectors contain three values, meaning `n` has a value of three. After we carry out subtractions, the values look like this:

Next, the values in the vector are squared. Then NumPy sums the values, and your result is the error value for that prediction and a score for the quality of the model.
